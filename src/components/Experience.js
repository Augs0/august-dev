            <p>I currently work in educational technology (or EdTech) for a private university. My role involves creating and improving on our products, primarily using HTML, CSS, Javascript, with adhoc use of Node.js and PHP. I also help to maintain and edit products on Moodle. Outside of my main role, I have introduced the team to Git version control and coding more accessibly by writing in-depth in-house guides. Additionally, I ran a session on the basics of React.js after teaching myself the framework and also wrote the bulk of an in-house wiki-style site in React.js.</p>
            <p>Alongside my day job, I'm a volunteer with the NGO <a href="https://codeyourfuture.io/">CodeYourFuture</a>, who support refugees and other disadvantaged people to get into tech jobs. Currently, my role is a mixed one where I help to teach the coding syllabus, provide personal development support, organise events for our womxn's support network, and provide language support to students, which currently focuses on English and Spanish.</p>
