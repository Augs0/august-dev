            <p>I currently work in government administration. My day-to-day work involves Node.js and Javascript more generally, as well as use of nunjucks templates. We follow an Agile way of work and use a CI/CD pipeline to monitor and iterate development work.</p>
            <p>Alongside my day job, I'm a volunteer with the NGO <a href="https://codeyourfuture.io/">CodeYourFuture</a>, who support refugees and other disadvantaged people to get into tech jobs. Currently, my role is a mixed one where I help to teach the coding syllabus, provide personal development support, organise events for our women's and non-binary support network, and provide language support to students, which currently focuses on English and Spanish.</p>
